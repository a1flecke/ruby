# Ruby Cloud Native Buildpack

The Ruby Cloud Native Buildpack provides a set of collaborating buildpacks that
enable the building of a Ruby-based application. These buildpacks include:
- [MRI CNB](https://github.com/paketo-community/mri)
- [Bundler CNB](https://github.com/paketo-community/bundler)
- [Bundle Install CNB](https://github.com/paketo-community/bundle-install)

The buildpack supports building simple Ruby applications or applications which
utilize either [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) for managing their dependencies.
